Scripts explained
=================

The docdata scripts operate independent from the web application
and cms. Actions are determined by the docdata_stat, docdata_action
and docdata_sent columns in the database.

Three tables have these columns, namely:
* as_products
* as_orders
* as_order_products

as_products is used by:
- article_info.php
- article_info_result.php
- article_info_stock.php

as_orders and as_order_products are used by:
- sales_order.php
- sales_order_result.php


article_info.php
================

Takes all as_products with docdata_stat = 'unknown', creates xml-file
with STATUS determined by docdata_action and updates as_products.docdata_stat
to 'waiting' and docdata_sent to the current time. Then the xml-file can be
uploaded to the docdata ftp-server.


article_info_result.php (called by process_pulled_files.php)
============================================================

Updates all docdata_stat to 'accepted' or 'denied' depending on the STATUS value in the
xml-file. If the docdata_action was 'delete' then deletes the article from the database.


article_info_stock.php (called by process_pulled_files.php)
===========================================================

Updates all docdata_stat to 'accepted' or 'denied' depending on the STATUS value in the
xml-file. Also updates as_products.stock to the value from the xml-file.


sales_order.php
===============

Takes all as_orders with docdata_stat = 'unknown', creates xml-file
with STATUS determined by docdata_action and updates as_orders.docdata_stat
to 'waiting', docdata_sent to the current time and as_order_products.docdata_sequence_nr
to an incrementing integer (starting at 1 for the first product in the order). Then the
resulting xml-file can be uploaded to the docdata ftp-server.


sales_order_result.php (called by process_pulled_files.php)
===========================================================

Updates all as_order.docdata_stat to 'accepted', 'denied' or 'shipped' depending on the
STATUS value in the xml-file. Also updates as_order_products.docdata_quantity_shipped, 
docdata_sequence_nr, docdata_shipping_date, docdata_tracktrace_nr, docdata_transported_by.


notify_customer.php (called by process_pulled_files.php)
========================================================

Takes all as_orders with docdata_stat = 'shipping', mails the shop owner and the customer
that the order is shipped and updates docdata_stat to 'notified'.


process_pulled_files.php
========================

Processes incoming result xml-files from docdata by calling one of the earlier described
scripts.
